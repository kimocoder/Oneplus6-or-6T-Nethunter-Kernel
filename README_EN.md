# Foreword

Whatsup guys , this is a trash noob rookie geek(ID:DJY) from China , today I want to share my project to you guys within my truly heart and hope you will enjoy it. Nethunter Kernel is an oneplus 6 and 6T full function¡¯s patch kernel, support hackrf, RTL-SDR , mouse jack, osmcombb+C118+openbts(these are basically hardwares) , Bluetooth attack , external infrared module , external OTG cable run pppoe router password sniff , OTG external multiple wireless network cables RTX series, MT7601 series, ahk9 series and htc series). Proxmark3 CDC HID diver support, chameleon-Mini diver support. This project is totally open source , no need to pay for it, please notice becasue there are some bitches selling it now(xxeyes team), and also check the MD5 value and hash value. For compile and debug this kernel I¡¯ve brush the device for hundreds of times , to solve the problems such as: flash kernel can¡¯t be open , can¡¯t use abd shell , can not external USB sevices, black screen , stuck at first screen and so on. It¡¯s been a long time for test and if there is still having bug, welcome to report. If you think this is useful please please please give me a ***STAR***  , your support is my
best motivation . ^ _ ^

And I will add some ¡®special words¡¯ to some losers , I don¡¯t owe you anything, or you can just choose to don¡¯t use it, but don¡¯t be like a dickhead that attack me. This is open source , I free share it , but all you did are not even say thank to me and just make some nonsense shit around, some fuckers even made my  thousand people group(2 groups!) that banned , what can you get from these? I wanna say more but I don¡¯t want to waste my fucking time to these piece of shit, so FUCK YOU

# Install

1.You have to go to https://twrp.me/ download the twrp that relate to your device, and go to https://www.oneplus.com/support/softwareupgrade/ to choose your device download system(notice: the user in China have to get cross the firewall to download oos, why we don¡¯t suggest the One Plus¡¯s HOS system? Because HOS system in China are being limited on some permission functions, so there will be some commands or the terminal that can¡¯t be normal use , but it still works, but it won¡¯t be perfect, so there will be more prefer on oos)

2.Use my uploaded payload_dumper win or linux unpack the payload.bin firmware, then brush into twrp, mount all partitions, clean up the userdate partition, then clean up select all partitions and use my upload flash.sh or bat to brush In all the mirrors. This is the new OOS. ^ _ ^

3.After brush the TWRP , rebrush it(yes you have to brush it for twice), then choose adb sideload to push my DJY Nethunter Kernel.
```
adb sideload DJY XXX.ZIP
```
4.Then restart to the system, remember to skip the direct selection when the  user in China restarts, do not connect to WIFI or unplug the SIM card, because you will be called to log in to Google, if you do not link VPN, your router will stuck you on the Google login page. Then enter the mobile desktop environment, connect to WIFI or 4G, open the magisk app to update (note here, if you do not open the magisk update for the first time, it will cause the magisk  SafetyNet system security check can not pass) and then restart.

5.Open the magisk selection module, brush into my WIFI firmware package, now you can use the nethunter kernel perfectly.

```
The correct operation process: twrp>Download OOS>payload_dumper payload.bin>flash.sh or bat>adb sideload DJY XXX.zip>Reboot>Open magisk for the first time to connect to network to update for pass my SafetyNet Status Check>Reboot> Brush to my WIFI module > Start loading

```

6, For brush into kalifs-full.tar.xz Here I recommend three methods, the first and second are all use linux deploy to install, the third one is to use nethunter app to install. Official link https://build.nethunter.com/kalifs/kalifs-20190228/
The first
![pic](images/install1.JPG)
Second
![pic](images/install2.JPG)
Third
![pic](images/install3.jpg)

```
Note here that if you download arm64, amd64, i386 bit version of kalifs-full.tar.xz, you need to change the file name in the package to armhf. If you don't change it, nh terminal and nethunter will not be recognized and installed. The kernel has built-in busybox1.31, so there is no need to download the busybox installer.

```
# Update_History

- [DJY0.1-DJY11] Fix many bugs, add HID attack support, add network card support, unlock mobile phone built-in AM/FM chip can receive AM/FM signal without using SDR, CP210x, FTDI, CH341 module. Unlock Bluetooth module support (Bluetooth attack), add the @simonpunk nethunter app usbarmy module, add and modify the @rithvikvibhu WIFI module for more support and fix support for the 9.0Pie system. Test system OP6T_O2_BETA_04

- [DJY11-DJY13] Fixed a lot of script errors, optimized kernel update, updated nethunter app, added kernel patch to permanently set selinux to permissive, updated WIFI firmware error script, updated busybox to 1.31, fixed the bug that busybox could not install 

- [DJY13-DJY15] Update nethunterapp, update nethunter-nh terminal, add update app into WIFI firmware package, delete WIFI firmware flash package extra code, add pn532 module, update kernel code compilation, repair HID attack occasionally can not be used .

(Because 15 or more have joined the osmcombb and openbts automatic environment scripts, they have violated the relevant China laws, so the kernel of 15+ or higher will not be announced)

- [DJY15-DJY17] Add Proxmark3 CDC driver, add osmcombb one-click environment configuration script, one-click brush script. Test system OP6T_O2_BETA_05

- [DJY17-DJY18] Add pppoe USB external driver to increase the function of sniffing router pppoe password, unlock the full function of mobile phone NFC, add amateur radio support, and optimize the kernel overall.

- [DJY18-DJY19] Add openbts+c118 one-click pseudo base station configuration script, join GSM Sniff WEB GUI interface ###Complete progress percent 100#####

- [DJY15-3] Fix nethunter app to remove kali.tar.xz error and add support for i386 amd64 arm64 chroot. Add a lot of firmware, update the WIFI firmware from 2008 to 2019, update the kernel code as a whole, add some common apks, update the terminal app, update the app toolchain, fix the update busybox is not properly installed, add boot animation (if necessary You can extract the WIFI archive to replace the system/media/bootanimation.zip file). The above code is all the latest code compiled using gcc 8.2.1 studio 3.5 canary7 test system: official OOS stable version and OOS beta 7。Newly compiled HID attack app, this app can use HID attacks without chroot installation kali, but requires kernel support.(The hackrf limesdr USRP UHD test is now perfectly supported.)

- [DJY23] openbts5.0 has been compiled successfully. Now you can build a small GSM base station test network using 1 + 6 and 1 + 6T, support hackrf C118 RTL-SDR to send and receive content ~~(can make calls and send text messages within the signal range, theoretical support, also supports USRP and limeSDR. But I don't have the relevant equipment so I can't test it.)~~( Hackrf limesdr usrp has been tested by UHD)

# FAQ
1、If the nethunter app and nh terminal use exceptions, please download OOS.

2、If the magisk SafetyNet status check does not work properly, please restore the boot image and rebrush the magisk https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases

3、If you can't execute bootkali in the adb shell or Android shell, please rebrush the WIFI module.

4、if you use linux deploy installed kali, and can not start postgesql , please refer to the following code, mysql is the same.
``` 
nano /usr/sbin/update-rc.d
# Blacklist
# postgresql disabled (comment)

#Whitelist
postgresql enabled (add)
-----
than you need to grand permisson of postgresql
usermod -a -G aid_inet postgres 
service postgresql start
exit
bootkali
```
5、 If WIFITE and fluxion are not working properly, refer to https://www.bilibili.com/video/av45973380

~~6、If kalifs-full.tar.xz does not work properly with the new nethunter app, please refer to the temporary solution below. I will fix the Nethunter app later。(already fixed)~~


~~adb push kalifs-full.tar.xz /sdcard/ 
adb shell
su
mv /sdcard/kalifs-full.tar.xz /data/local/nhsystem/
cd /data/local/nhsystem/
xz -d kalifs-full.tar.xz
tar xvf kalifs-full.tar~~
